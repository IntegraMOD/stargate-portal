First off, the portal includes code to automatically load style specific smilies... 

For example, if your styles folder contains a theme/images/smilies folder, the smilies in that folder will be used in place of the default smilies... 
You must of course ensure you have a smilies for each of the default smilies and obviously their names must match...
This modification was added to circumvent the horrible effects of using smilies that do not match a theme when the user changes stales...

Additionally, this folder contains several of the more common smilies, which we have edited so that they now work with light and dark themes too...

Most of the originals should all be freely available on the net however, the originals only support light themes...
