Updates:

STARGATE definition, and config.php:
Removed all portal definitions from config.php...

STARGATE is now defined in common.php and dependant on: $config['portal_enabled']
To disable the cache debug information you can modify: @define('DEBUG_QUERIES', false);

Enabling/Disabling the portal:
You can now enable/disable the portal via APC board settings...


Displaying blocks on different pages:

1) You can now display bock and all pages except Staff Members page (would;d require additional and complex alterations).
2) Page are classified: portal, Index and other... Other pages normally display both sets of blocks but can  be disable individually with individual edits... May add to ACP later...

Block and Menus:
Removed the alt variable that was used to store image alt data... not needed...
